~Function Planning~
-------------------
step:
step counter is handled by a for loop. 
1 step is a player turn

reward:
reward is given based on the is_valid function

main:
game needs to have different setup based on human or agent

setup:
initialize objects (ball, player, q-table(if agent)) based on human/agent,
reset the game,
render the first state

make_q_table:
"possible actions 0=w, 1=a, 2=s, 3=d"
a = all_ball_pos (list)  = all possible coords ball could be
b = all_player_pos (list) = all possible coords player could be

[(x,y) for x in a for y in b]

Three entries in the final list would look like:
"( (ball_x, ball_y) , (player_x, player_y) )"
( (0,0) , (0,0) )
( (0,0) , (0,1) )
( (0,0) , (0,2) )

Those would be the index. Then columns = [0,1,2,3] which correspond to [w,a,s,d]
