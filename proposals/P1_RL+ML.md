## Motivation **+** Project Description
#
It is no secret I have a passion for Rocket League and machine learning. With my next project, I aim to gain a much deeper understanding of both RL+ML and further advance toward my ultimate goal of an advanced Rocket League bot. Using reinforcement learning to make a bot is "the holy grail for many ML enthusiasts in the RLBot community"[*](https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot/wiki/Machine-Learning-FAQ). Due to the multifaceted nature of teaching an AI how to _understand_ the game of RL, I will focus on a single piece of the puzzle:  
**Where should I <sub><sup>_(the bot)_</sub></sup> be in order to be part of an effective play?**

## Approach **+** Data
#
This section is very much a formative one. The more I research and the further I get into [this deeplizard series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZbbT5o_s2xoWNVdDudn51XM8lOuZ_Njv) on reinforcement learning, the better my predictions become for what I _actually_ need to do.    
In essence, I will need to build a system to determine how "valuable" an arbritrary position on the field is, given _some_ information. Then I will need to teach an agent how to map that state to an action.

Alternatively, I could do something more simple, like train a neural network on professional players' positions and have it predict what the bot's next move should be. Something along the lines of "given the position of the 5 other players on the field and the position of the ball, where should the 6th player be".
  
**TL,DR:** I have access to the tools I need, I have loads of replay files for data, but I am actively researching my exact process for a solution.  Basically, I have a good amount of pieces to a puzzle, a general idea of what the finished product looks like, but I'm still figuring out how everything fits together.
